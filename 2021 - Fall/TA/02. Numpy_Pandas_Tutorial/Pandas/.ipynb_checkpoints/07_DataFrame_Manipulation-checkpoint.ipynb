We've alluded to some of these already, such as using vectorization whenever possible, and not using iterative loops if you don't need to. Several developers and users within the Panda's community have used the term pandorable for these idioms. I think it's a great term. So, I wanted to share with you a couple of key features of how you can make your code pandorable."
